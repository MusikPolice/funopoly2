A Monopoly implementation written in Kotlin. 

The long term goal for this project is to build a monte-carlo simulation that evaluates the relative "fun" level
of different house rules that are commonly used when playing the game. 

For now, the focus is on building a correct and fully tested implementation of the base game that adheres exactly 
to the official rules as published in game editions dating from 2021.
